      question: "How does crypto-backed lending work?",
      answer: "You deposit your crypto assets as collateral and borrow stablecoins against them. Your crypto remains in a secure smart contract while you access liquidity without selling your holdings."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my collateral value drops?",
      answer: "If your loan-to-value ratio exceeds the liquidation threshold (typically 80%), your collateral may be partially liquidated to maintain the required ratio. You'll receive notifications before this happens."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I get my loan?",
      answer: "Loans are processed instantly once your transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. There's no credit check or approval process - just deposit collateral and borrow immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the interest rates?",
      answer: "Interest rates are dynamic and based on supply and demand. Current rates start from 3.5% APY for USDC and 4.2% APY for USDT, with competitive rates that adjust automatically."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I repay my loan early?",
      answer: "Yes, you can repay your loan at any time without penalties. Interest is calculated based on the actual borrowing period, so early repayment saves you money."
    },
    {
      question: "What crypto assets can I use as collateral?",
      answer: "We currently support Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Chainlink (LINK), and Uniswap (UNI) as collateral. You can borrow USDC and USDT against these assets. More assets will be added based on community demand and security assessments."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my crypto safe?",
      answer: "Yes, your assets are secured in audited smart contracts. We use multi-signature wallets, regular security audits, and insurance coverage to protect user funds."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to complete KYC?",
      answer: "For loans under $10,000, no KYC is required. Larger loans may require identity verification to comply with regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction."
